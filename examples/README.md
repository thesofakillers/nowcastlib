### Rawdata

The notebook [rawdata.ipynb](./rawdata.ipynb) serves to demonstrate the usage of
the [rawdata](../nowcastlib/rawdata.py) submodule in the context of processing
raw data. Particularly, the user is guided through the handling of data incoming
from different data sources, so that it is correctly synchronized and chunked,
while taking into account missing data and different sample rates.
