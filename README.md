# Nowcast Library

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîß Utils that can be reused and shared across and beyond the ESO Nowcast
project

This is a public repository hosted on GitHub via a push mirror setup in the
[internal ESO GitLab repository](https://gitlab.eso.org/gstarace/nowcastlib/)

## Installation

Simply run

```console
pip install nowcastlib
```

## Usage and Documentation

Nowcast Library consists in a collection of functions organized in submodules
(API) and a tool accessible via the command line (CLI).

Please refer to the
[examples folder](https://github.com/thesofakillers/nowcastlib/tree/master/examples)
on GitHub for usage examples.

### API

Here is a quick example of how one may import nowcastlib and get access to one
of the functions:

```python
"""Example showing how to access compute_trig_fields function"""
import nowcastlib as ncl
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data_df = pd.DataFrame(
    [[0, 3, 4, np.NaN], [32, 4, np.NaN, 4], [56, 8, 0, np.NaN]],
    columns=["A", "B", "C"],
    index=pd.date_range(start="1/1/2018", periods=4, freq="2min"),
)

result = ncl.rawdata.compute_trig_fields(data_df, ["A", "C"])
```

More in-depth API documentation can be found
[here](https://giuliostarace.com/nowcastlib/).

### CLI

Some of the library's functionality is bundled in configurable subcommands
accessible via the terminal with the command `nowcastlib`:

```console
usage: nowcastlib [-h] {triangulate,chunksync} ...

positional arguments:
  {triangulate,chunksync}
                        available commands
    triangulate         Run `nowcastlib triangulate -h` for further help
    chunksync           Run `nowcastlib chunksync -h` for further help

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

## Development Setup

This repository relies on [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for tracking
dependencies, building and publishing. It is therefore recommended that
developers [install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and
make use of it throughout their development of the project.

### Dependencies

Make sure you are in the right Python environment and run

```console
poetry install
```

This reads [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml), resolves the dependencies, and
installs them.

### Deployment

The repository is published to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), so to make it
accessible via a `pip install` command as mentioned [earlier](#install).

To publish changes follow these steps. Ideally this process is automated via a
CI tool triggered by a push/merge to the master branch:

1. Optionally run
   [`poetry version`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version) with the
   appropriate argument based on [semver guidelines](https://semver.org/).

2. Update the documentation by running

   ```console
   make document
   ```

3. Prepare the package by running

   ```console
   poetry build
   ```

4. Ensure you have [TestPyPi](https://test.pypi.org/) and PyPi configured as
   your poetry repositories:

   ```console
   poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
   poetry config repositories.pypi https://pypi.org/
   ```

5. Publish the repository to TestPyPi, to see that everything works as expected:

   ```console
   poetry publish -r testpypi
   ```

6. Stage, commit and push your changes (to master) with git.
7. Publish the repository to PyPi:

   ```console
   poetry publish -r pypi
   ```
